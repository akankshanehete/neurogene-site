                <p className='left-col para'>Friedreichâ€™s ataxia (or FRDA) is a rare genetic disease caused 
                by mutations in the Frataxin gene. This disease is characterized by neuron degeneration 
                and is eventually fatal. FRDA will usually confine 
                individuals to a wheelchair after the first onset of symptoms, and the most common cause of death 
                in sufferers are heart problems.
